python 是所有高级语言中最适合机器学习的。它有着简洁明了的设计，和不那么复杂的语法。
他对所有的刚刚接触编程的学习者来说都是友好的，它不会像C语言那样有着严谨的数理逻辑、和
一些让人无比头疼的数据结构。
总之，在python看来这个编程的世界很精彩。

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
